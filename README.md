# The project explores data related to the bike-sharing system.

This project, created on 2022/07/13, uses Python to explore and analyze data related to bike-sharing systems in three major U.S. citiesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The goal is to answer interesting questions about the data by computing descriptive statistics and creating an interactive terminal experience to present these statistics.

## Description

The project involves writing Python code to import data, compute descriptive statistics, and create an interactive terminal experience. The data is related to **bike-sharing systems** in Chicago, New York City, and Washington, providing an opportunity to compare the usage between these cities and draw valuable insights.

## Files used

The main files used in this project are:

- `data.csv`: This is the dataset that the project is based on.
- `analysis.py`: This is the Python script used to analyze the data and create visualizations.
- `report.pdf`: This is the final report that presents the insights from the analysis.

## Credit

This project was inspired by the [Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Program](https://learn.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd104). I also consulted several blog posts on Medium and Stack Overflow threads to help with the data analysis and visualization techniques.
